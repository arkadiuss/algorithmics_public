tips:
-always take care of long long and proper type
-dijkstra is always good idea when you can make good graph to use it
-sometimes it is really good idea to try Monte Carllo algorithms
-remember about O(sqrt(n)) - you an divide it to sqrt(n) problems and count something in two ways - for small and big
-if some input is small try to use bits
-sorting point by angle is often used
-sometimes you can clean sth up using broom
-input and output times of verticle in tree
-there is a lot of operations that you can do on binary tree (e.g. jump)
-always test your solutions, write brute and test it
-sometimes you can look at problem like a graph(cartezian)
-remember about binary searching of answer
-some solutions are t 


to learn:
-bridges and articulation points
-dynamics
