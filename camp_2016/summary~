-Convex Hull Trick - for example for finding group of biznesmens, which contain the reachest men, according to rate.
-Fermat's little theorem.
-Modular multiplicative inverse.
-nimbers and xors to game theory (Sprague-Grundy theorem) - nimber of state is a mex of states, which you can achieve.
-probability algorithms
-xor

Algorithms:
